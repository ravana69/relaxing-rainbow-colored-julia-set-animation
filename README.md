# Relaxing Rainbow Colored Julia Set Animation

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/learosema/pen/RmJBvv](https://codepen.io/learosema/pen/RmJBvv).

This is an animated Julia set, showing zÂ²+c with c = 0.7885*e^(i*phi).

I took the Julia code from the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) article and translated it to glsl.

For the rainbow colors, I used a [hsl2rgb](https://github.com/Jam3/glsl-hsl2rgb) function by [Matt Deslauriers](https://codepen.io/mattdesl/).
